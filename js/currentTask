Refactoring code to fit the changes:

Before - damageInfo & healInfo contains data.parentMob as target / source
After - damageInfo & healInfo contains data (dataBackend) itself as target / source

dataBackend: any background data
** Stop casting and clear any casting action when entering new scene

? Delete ghost backend data & keep focus list clean for mobs ?

player.targetTriangle: "the child is not mine" when removing from me.game.world
